# Flask Repos

![Flask Repos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1257048/204000578-b8185c2f-6df5-4f63-8f26-3265b3cf01a7.png)

This repository contains a collection of examples showcasing the usage of 
the [Flask framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). Each application 
in this repository is independent and has its own `requirements.txt` file.

## Environment Setup

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
    ```
